            <p>Have you ever noticed one-hour meetings are rarely just that; they often run at least five minutes over.</p>
            <p>And why is it that the decisions are usually made during the last five-ten minutes of any meeting?</p>
            <p>In actual fact, it is quite understandable.</p>
            <p>The thing is, we humans tend to stick to time limits.</p>
            <p>That means that if people are invited for an hour meeting, they put themselves in that mindset before the meeting.</p>
            <p>And if the meeting is only fifteen minutes, they set themselves in a different mindset.</p>
            <p>For an hour long meeting, people usually prepare more comfortably. They make sure they have gone to the bathroom, have a fresh cup of coffee ready at the table, and are at ease, before joining the meeting.</p>
            <p>If the meeting is only fifteen minutes long, where it is understood beforehand the meeting cannot and will not be extended, then people tend to prepare differently.</p>
            <p>They tend to be well prepared by making sure all possible technical issues are handled before the meeting, all agenda points have been prepared for, and usually join the meeting room three-five minutes before it starts to ensure the meeting can start exactly on time.</p>
            <p>This is interesting in two ways:</p>
            <p> First of all, it’s interesting how efficient a meeting can be with a non-extendable time limit.</p>
            <p>But, then again, it’s not that surprising.</p>
            <p>Think about it–it’s similar to anything else in life where you only have one shot; exams, buying a house, a date with a guy/girl, etc.</p>
            <p>You always prepare for all these situations because you know that you cannot just ask for another try afterward.</p>
            <p>Secondly, if that is the case, why not make all your meetings into fifteen-minute meetings instead?</p>
            <p>If you typically have fifteen hours of meetings per week (which is not untypical for managers), then that could be cut down to a quarter, meaning three hours and forty-five minutes of meetings during a week, instead.</p>
            <p>Therefore, there would be a lot more time that could then be used on actually helping the company progress.</p>
            <p>So, test it out and let me know what you think.</p>
