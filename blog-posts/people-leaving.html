<p>When friends tell me that they are getting a divorce (yes, I am now at that age where this is actually happening!) I always congratulate them.</p>

<p>The fact that the couple has concluded that they will divorce tells us that something must have been wrong in the relationship, which now made them decide that it would be the best thing to move on.</p>

<p>Similar to this, when a person on my team tells me that they have found a new job, I always congratulate them.</p>

<p>It tells me that there must have been something that the person hasn’t been satisfied with concerning his or her work situation and that they have now found a solution to the issue.</p>

<p>Namely, a new job.</p>

<p>This is good for both the employee and the manager.</p>

<p>As a manager, no one wants a person on their team that does not actually want to be there.It will only create problems.</p>

<p>If this employee was, however, a person who was well-liked on the team and who delivered solid results, I always try to ask myself or them what ultimately drove them to the decision of leaving.</p>

<p>You never know if it might have been due to your management style.</p>

<p>And if it was, then you should always try to adjust and learn from it.</p>
