        <p>Having worked in 3 different countries and rented around 10 different apartments, I have gathered some experience on how to decide if the salary offered by a new job is sufficient or not depending on your living expenses in a particular city and country.</p>
        <p>My main learning point: You should always follow the 20 percent rent principle. Read on to learn more.  </p>
        <p>For most people, rent seems to swallow the biggest chunk of their monthly salaries. Thus, it is always important to find out approximately how much you will have to pay in rent when moving to a new city.</p>
        <p>Most people tend to base an approximate amount for rent on either what their peers pay or what they themselves have paid in the past. These are the sole measures used when they decide and conclude whether or not it is a cheap or an expensive place to rent.</p>
        <p>This is, however, not an optimal way to decide it as it does not take your actual salary into account.</p>
        <p>I believe that a much better way to look at this is by basing it on a percentage taken from your net salary and only allow for a maximum of 20% of your net income per month to go to rent.</p>
        <p>If you start doing this you will always have money for savings, investing as well as fun things such as going to restaurants and bars.</p>
        <p>So, let‚Äôs look at an example.</p>
        <p>Let‚Äôs say that you earn 3500 USD after tax each month. 20% of 3500 USD is 700 USD, which will be the maximum amount that you should be allowed to pay in rent.</p>
        <h3>The framework</h3>
        <p>Before you start following this rule you first need to decide on what your standard of living is. Do you want to live in a minimum 4 room apartment with a view of a lake? Or are you perfectly comfortable with a 1-bedroom apartment on the outskirts of the city? That‚Äôs completely up to you.</p>
        <p>Secondly, you should start looking into what the average rent is for the kind of apartment you want to live in ‚Äì and in that particular city.</p>
        <p>When you have gathered this information, you can then start applying the rule.</p>
        <p>If you are offered a new job in an interesting city and you already know that the average apartment would cost you 20% of your proposed monthly salary ‚Äì or less ‚Äì then say yes to the job immediately.</p>
        <p>So üëç</p>
        <p>If you find out that the average apartment would cost you more than 20% of the proposed salary, you should ask for a higher salary. If your potential new employer is not willing to raise your salary, you should then respectfully say no thank you to their offer.</p>
        <p>So üñï</p>
        <p>If the job you are offered is your dream job and you cannot get the employer to pay a higher salary, you can consider lowering your expectations for your ideal living situation. Maybe you could lend out a room or find a 1-room apartment instead of a 2-room one.</p>
        <p>So ü§î</p>
        <p>No matter what, it can always be beneficial to aim for the 20 percent rent rule as this will help your overall financial situation in the long run.</p>
