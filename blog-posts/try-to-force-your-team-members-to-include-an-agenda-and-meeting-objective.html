        <p>Far too often do I receive an invitation for a meeting which only has a subject line; the invite is vague and doesn’t give any indication as to what the purpose of the conference is, or what we will discuss during it.</p>
        <p>In my experience, conferences like this are rarely productive.</p>
        <p>Without an agenda or objective, people don’t have the chance to prepare, as the only information they have is from the title of the invite.</p>
        <p>Therefore, they don’t really know what the meeting is about and, with no apparent purpose or clear plan outlined for the attendees, this will most likely lead to disorganised discussions which don’t produce any resolutions.</p>
        <p>When I receive invites like this, I always write to the person who sent it to me to ask that they add, both, an agenda and objective to their invitation.</p>
        <p>Fortunately, most of the time, when I word my request nicely enough, the invite is amended, and these are both added.</p>
        <p>By requesting these details be added to the invitation, this can, at times, lead to interesting developments.</p>
        <p>First of all, when I ask if an agenda can be included, it forces the meeting organiser to think about what should actually be involved in the discussion; this will usually lead to the meeting flowing much better and being more conclusive.</p>
        <p>In the past, there have also been cases where this has lead to the organiser cancelling the meeting altogether.</p>
        <p>They have realised what they meant to discuss in a 30-minute session could easily be discussed over, and solved, in one email.</p>
        <p>Secondly, because it is not compulsory to have an agenda when you arrange a meeting, most people are too lazy to write one.</p>
        <p>If it were mandatory for teams, it would most likely lead to, not only, better and more conducive meetings, but fewer meetings as it may be realised beforehand that it was unnecessary.</p>
        <p>There is nothing worse than a meeting where people are not prepared as it’s always a waste of everyone’s time; this could easily be avoided by having an agenda, which is why it should be mandatory for all meeting requests.</p>
